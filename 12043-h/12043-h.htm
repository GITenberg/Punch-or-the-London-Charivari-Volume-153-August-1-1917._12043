    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The Imperial aspirations of KING FERDINAND are discussed by
    a Frankfort paper in an article entitled "What Bulgaria wants."
    Significantly enough the ground covered is almost identical
    with the subject-matter of an unpublished article of our own,
    entitled "What Bulgaria won't get."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The cow which walked down sixteen stairs into a cellar at
    Willesden is said to have been the victim of a false air-raid
    warning.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"In Scotland," says Mr. BARNES'S report on Industrial
    Unrest, "the subject of liquor restrictions was never
    mentioned." Some thoughts are too poignant for utterance.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the statement of a German paper "A Partial
    Crisis" threatens Austria. One of these days we feel sure
    something really serious will happen to that country.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Medical Officer of the L.C.C. estimates that in 1916 the
    total water which flowed under London Bridge was
    875,000,000,000 gallons. It is not known yet what is to be done
    about it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Army Council has forbidden the sale of raffia in the
    United Kingdom. Personally we never eat the stuff.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Nature Notes: A white sparrow has been seen in Huntingdon; a
    well-defined solar halo has been observed in Hertfordshire, and
    Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL was noticed the other day reading <i>The
    Morning Post</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A boy of eighteen told the Stratford magistrate that he had
    given up his job because he only got twenty-five shillings a
    week. He will however continue to give the War his moral
    support.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Austrian EMPEROR has told the representative of <i>The
    Cologne Gazette</i> that he "detests war." If not true this is
    certainly a clever invention on KARL'S part.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We feel that the public need not have been so peevish
    because the experimental siren air-raid warning was not heard
    by everybody in London. They seem to overlook the fact that
    full particulars of the warning appeared next morning in the
    papers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man who obtained two hundred-weight of sugar from a firm
    of ship-brokers has been fined ten pounds at Glasgow. Some
    curiosity exists as to the number of ships he had to purchase
    in order to secure that amount of sugar.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A London magistrate has held that tea and dinner concerts in
    restaurants are subject to the entertainment tax. This decision
    will come as a great shock to many people who have always
    regarded the music as an an&aelig;sthetic.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The no-tablecloths order has caused great perturbation among
    the better-class hotel-keepers in Berlin. Does the Government,
    they ask sarcastically, expect their class of patron to wipe
    their mouths on their shirt-cuffs?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The chairman of the House of Commons' Tribunal complains
    that while cats drink milk as usual they no longer catch mice.
    This however may easily be remedied if the FOOD-CONTROLLER will
    meet them halfway on the question of dilution.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The public has been warned by Scotland Yard against a man
    calling himself Sid Smith. We wouldn't do it ourselves, of
    course, but we are strongly opposed to the police interfering
    in what is after all purely a matter of personal taste.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The bones of ST. GEORGE have been discovered near Beersheba
    in Palestine by members of our Expeditionary Force. This should
    dispel the popular delusion which has always ascribed the last
    resting-place of England's patron saint to the present site of
    the Mint.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"War bread will keep for a week," stated Mr. CLYNES for the
    Ministry of Food. Of course you can keep it longer if you are
    collecting curios.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is announced that all salaries in the German Diplomatic
    Service have been reduced. We always said that frightfulness
    didn't really pay.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>German women have been asked to place their hair at the
    disposal of the authorities. If they do not care to sacrifice
    their own hair they can just send along the handful or two
    which they collect in the course of waiting in the butter
    queue.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Hamlet</i> has been rendered by amateur actors at the
    Front, all scenery being dispensed with. If you must dispense
    with one or the other, why not leave out the acting?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"To assist in the breaking-up of grass-land," we are told,
    "the Board of Agriculture proposes to allocate a number of
    horses to agricultural counties." The idea of allocating some
    of our incurable golfers to this purpose does not appear to
    have suggested itself to our slow-witted authorities.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"I have resigned because there is no further need for my
    services," said Mr. KENNEDY-JONES. Several politicians are of
    the opinion that this was not a valid reason.</p>

    <p>The <i>Berlin Tageblatt</i> says that HERR MIHAELIS in the

    <h2>DUSTBIN.</h2>

    <p>He dropped in to tea, quite casually; forced an entry
    through the mud wall of our barn, in fact. No, he wouldn't sit
    down&mdash;expected to be leaving in a few minutes; but he
    didn't mind if he did have a sardine, and helped himself to the
    tinful. Yes, a bit of bully, thanks, wouldn't be amiss; and a
    nice piece of coal; cockchafers very good too when, as now, in
    season; and, for savoury, a little nibble with a yard of tarred
    string and an empty cardboard cigarette-box. Thank you very
    much.</p>

    <p>"Why, the little brute's a perfect dustbin," said my mate;
    and "Dustbin" the puppy was throughout his stay with us.</p>

    <p>For six weeks did Dustbin&mdash;attached for rations and
    discipline&mdash;accompany us on our sanitary rounds; set us a
    fine example of indifference to shell fire, even to the extent
    of attempting to catch spent shrapnel as it fell; and proved
    the wettest of wet blankets to the "socials" of the local rats.
    Then, as happens with sanitary inspectors in France, there
    arrived late one afternoon a despatch requesting the pleasure
    of my society&mdash;in five hours' time&mdash;at a village some
    twenty kilos distant as the shell flies. I found I should have
    fifteen minutes in which to pack, four hours for my journey,
    and forty-five minutes between the packing and the start in
    which to find a home for Dustbin.</p>

    <p>"Take the little dorg off you?" said a Sergeant acquaintance
    in the D.A.C. "I couldn't, Corp'l. Why, I don't even know how
    I'm goin' to take the foal yonder"&mdash;he glared
    reproachfully at a placid Clydesdale mare and her tottering
    one-day-old; "and 'ow I'm goin' to take my posh
    breeches&mdash;"</p>

    <p>I left him hovering despondently over his equipment and a
    pile of dirty linen.</p>

    <p>We tried the M.G.C. We were on the best of terms and always
    had been; they said so. They apologised in advance for the
    insanitary conditions I might find; inquired after my health;
    offered me some coffee and generally loved me; but they
    couldn't love my dog. The Cook even went so far as openly to
    associate my guileless puppy with a shortage of dried herrings
    in the sergeants' mess.</p>

    <p>Passing through the E.A.M.C. transport lines I rescued
    Dustbin from a hulking native mongrel wearing an identity disc.
    I judged the Ambulance would not be wanting another dog; but
    there was still hope with the Salvage Company.</p>

    <p>The Salvagier whom I met upon the threshold of the "billet"
    (half a limber load of bricks and an angle iron) was quite sure
    the Salvage Company couldn't take a dog, as they had an infant
    wild boar and two fox cubs numbering on their strength; but he
    thought that he could plant my prodigy with a friend of his, a
    bombardier in the E.G.A., the only other unit within easy
    distance. We headed for the E.G.A.</p>

    <p>It was just at this point that there occurred one of those
    little incidents so dear to the comic draughtsman, but less
    popular with "us." A moaning howl, a rushing hissing sound, a
    moment of tense and awful silence, a devastating crash, and the
    E.G.A. officers' bath-house, "erected at enormous trouble and
    expense" by a handful of T.U. men and myself the day before,
    soared heavenwards with an acre or two of the surrounding
    scenery. "Yes," said the Salvage gentleman as he regained his
    perpendicular, "as I was sayin', 'is size is in 'is favour
    (you'd better git down ag'in, Corp'l)&mdash;'is size is in 'is
    favour; 'e'll go in a dixie easy, or even in a&mdash;(there's
    another bit orf the church)&mdash;even in a tin 'at, if you
    fold 'im up, but I'm 'fraid the 'eads ain't much in favour of a
    dog. Leastways the ole man I know was a member of the Cat
    Club&mdash;took a lot o' prizes at the Crys'l Pala..."</p>

    <p>"I think we'd better run this little bit, Corp'l," my guide
    said suddenly. It was advisable. A sprint along some two
    hundred yards of what had once been a road, with a stone wall
    (like a slab of <i>gruy&egrave;re</i> now, alas) upon our
    right, and we should once more have the comfortable feeling one
    always enjoys in a "hot" village when there are houses upon
    either hand. A trolley load of rations held the middle of the
    road; the ration party was, I believe, in the ditch upon the
    left; and a strangled voice exclaimed after each burst, "Oh
    crummy! I do 'ope they don't 'it the onions."</p>

    <p>We gave our forty-seventh impersonation of a pair of
    starfish, and then legged it for the apparent shelter of the
    houses. At least I did; the salvage man, less squeamish, found
    a haven in an adjacent cookhouse grease-trap and dust-shoot. I
    listened intently, but it was only the falling of spent
    shrapnel, not the patter of Dustbin's baby but quite enormous
    feet. A stove-pipe belching smoke and savoury fumes protruded
    itself through the pavement on my right. Through the chinks in
    the gaping slabs there came the ruddy flicker that bespoke a
    "home from home" beneath my feet; and then, still listening for
    signs of Dustbin, I heard&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Didn't I tell you, Erb, to stop up that extra ventilation
    'ole with somethin'?&mdash;and now look wot's blown in. 'Ere,
    steady on, ole man; that's got to last four men for three
    days."</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm &mdash;&mdash;," chimed in another voice, "if the
    bloomin' tin ain't empty. Why, I only just opened
    it&mdash;that's a 'ole Maconochie 'e's got inside 'im, not
    countin' wot you've just.... Poor little beggar must be
    starvin'. You're welcome to stop and share our grub, young
    feller, but I've got to go on p'rade wiv that&mdash;that's a
    belt, that is...."</p>

    <p>I turned towards the dimly lighted road that led to
    &mdash;&mdash; [Censored]. Dustbin had found a home.</p>

    <p>On the lazy afternoon breeze come the concerted yells of a
    bayonet class, practising frightfulness further down the
    valley; also the staccato chatter of Lewis guns punching holes
    in the near hill-side.</p>

    <p>In the centre of one meadow is a turf <i>man&egrave;ge</i>.
    In the centre of the <i>man&egrave;ge</i> stands the villain of
    the piece, the Riding-Master.</p>

    <p>He wears a crown on his sleeve, tight breeches, jack-boots,
    vicious spurs and sable moustachios. His right hand toys with a
    long, long whip, his left with his sable moustachios. He looks
    like DIAVOLO, the lion-tamer, about to put his man-eating chums
    through hoops of fire.</p>

    <p>His victims, a dozen Infantry officers, circle slowly round
    the <i>man&egrave;ge</i>. They are mounted on disillusioned
    cavalry horses who came out with WELLINGTON and know a thing or
    two. Now and again they wink at the Riding-Master and he winks
    back at them.</p>

    <p>The audience consists of an ancient Gaul in picturesque blue
    pants, whose <i>m&eacute;tier</i> is to totter round the
    meadows brushing flies off a piebald cow; the School Padre, who
    keeps at long range so that he may see the sport without
    hearing the language, and ten little <i>gamins</i>, who have
    been splashing in the silver stream and are now sitting drying
    on the bank like ten little toads.</p>

    <p>They come every afternoon, for never have they seen such
    fun, never since the great days before the War when the circus
    with the boxing kangaroo and the educated porks came to
    town.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the Riding-Master clears his throat. At the sound
    thereof the horses cock their ears and their riders grab
    handfuls of leather and hair.</p>

    <p><i>R.-M.</i> "Now, gentlemen, mind the word. Gently away
    tra-a-a-at." The horses break into a slow jog-trot and the
    cavaliers into a cold perspiration. The ten little
    <i>gamins</i> cheer delightedly.</p>

    <p><i>R.-M.</i> "Sit down, sit up, 'ollow yer backs, keep the
    hands down backs foremost, even pace. Number Two, Sir, 'ollow
    yer back; don't sit 'unched up like you'd over-ate yourself.
    Number Seven, don't throw yerself about in that drunken manner,
    you'll miss the saddle altogether presently, coming
    down&mdash;can't expect the 'orse to catch you <i>every
    time</i>.</p>

    <p>"Number Three, don't flap yer helbows like an 'en; you ain't
    laid an hegg, 'ave you?</p>

    <p>"'Ollow yer backs, 'eads up, 'eels down; four feet from nose
    to croup.</p>

    <p>"Number One, keep yer feet back, you'll be kickin' that
    mare's teeth out, you will.</p>

    <p>"Come down off 'is 'ead, Number Seven; this ain't a monkey
    'ouse.</p>

    <p>"Keep a light an' even feelin' of both reins, backs of the
    'ands foremost, four feet from nose to croup.</p>

    <p>"Leggo that mare's tail, Number Seven; you're goin', not
    comin', and any'ow that mare likes to keep 'er tail to 'erself.
    You've upset 'er now, the tears is fair streamin' down 'er
    face&mdash;'ave a bit of feelin' for a pore dumb beast.</p>

    <p>"'Ollow yer backs, even pace, grip with the knees, shorten
    yer reins, four feet from nose to croup. Number Eight, restrain
    yerself, me lad, restrain yerself, you ain't shadow-sparrin',
    you know.</p>

    <p>"You too, Number Nine; if you don't calm yer action a bit
    you'll burst somethin'.</p>

    <p>"Now, remember, a light feelin' of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> the right rein and pressure
       of the left leg. Ride&mdash;wa-a-alk! Ri'&mdash;tur-r-rn!
       'Alt&mdash;'pare to s'mount&mdash;s'mount! Dismount, I said,
       Number Five; that means get down. No, don't dismount on the
       flat of yer back, me lad, it don't look nice. Try to
       remember you're an horfficer and be more dignified.</p>

    <p>"Now listen to me while I enumerate the parts of a norse in
    language so simple any bloomin' fool can understand. This'll be
    useful to you, for if you ever 'ave a norse to deal with and he
    loses one of 'is parts you'll know 'ow to indent for a new
    one.</p>

    <p>"The 'orse 'as two ends, a fore-end&mdash;so called from its
    tendency to go first, and an 'ind-end or rear rank. The 'orse
    is provided with two legs at each end, which can be easily
    distinguished, the fore legs being straight and the 'ind legs
    'avin' kinks in 'em.</p>

    <p>"As the 'orse does seventy-five per cent. of 'is dirty work
    with 'is 'ind-legs it is advisable to keep clear of 'em, rail
    'em off or strap boxing-gloves on 'em. The legs of the 'orse is
    very delicate and liable to crock up, so do not try to trim off
    any unsightly knobs that may appear on them with a
    hand-axe&mdash;a little of that 'as been known to spoil a norse
    for good.</p>

    <p>"Next we come to the 'ead. On the south side of the 'ead we
    discover the mouth. The 'orse's mouth was constructed for
    mincing 'is victuals, also for 'is rider to 'ang on by. As the
    'orse does the other forty-five per cent. of 'is dirty work
    with 'is mouth it is advisable to stand clear of that as well.
    In fact, what with his mouth at one end and 'is 'ind-legs at
    t'other, the middle of the 'orse is about the only safe spot,
    and <i>that is why we place the saddle there</i>. Everything in
    the Harmy is done with a reason, gentlemen.</p>

    <p>"And now, Number Ten, tell me what coloured 'orse you are
    ridin'?</p>

    <p>"A chestnut? No 'e ain't no chestnut and never was, no, nor
    a raspberry roan neither; 'e's a bay. 'Ow often must I tell you
    that a chestnut 'orse is the colour of lager beer, a brown
    'orse the colour of draught ale, and a black 'orse the colour
    of stout.</p>

    <p>"And now, gentlemen, stan' to yer 'orses, 'pare to
    mount&mdash;mount!</p>

    <p>"There you go, Number Seven, up one side and down the other.
    Try to stop in the saddle for a minute if only for the view.
    You'll get yourself 'urted one of these days dashing about all
    over the 'orse like that; and 'sposing you was to break your
    neck, who'd get into trouble? <i>Me</i>, not you. 'Ave a bit of
    consideration for other people, please.</p>

    <p>"Now mind the word. Ride&mdash;ri'&mdash;tur-r-rn. Walk
    march. Tr-a-a-at. Helbows slightly brushing the
    ribs&mdash;<i>your</i> ribs, not the 'orse's, Number Three.</p>

    <p>"Shorten yer reins, 'eels down, 'eads up, 'ollow yer backs,
    four feet from nose to croup.</p>

    <p>"Get off that mare's neck, Number Seven, and try ridin' in
    the saddle for a change; it'll be more comfortable for
    everybody.</p>

    <p>"You oughter do cowboy stunts for the movin' pictures,
    Number Six, you ought really. People would pay money to see you
    ride a norse upside down like that. Got a strain of wild
    Cossack blood in you, eh?</p>

    <p>"There you are, now you've been and fell off. Nice way to
    repay me for all the patience an' learning I've given you!</p>

    <p>"What are you lyin' there for? Day-dreaming? I s'pose you're
    goin' to tell me you're 'urted now?' Be writing 'ome to Mother
    about it next: 'DEAR MA,&mdash;A mad mustang 'as trod on me
    stummick. Please send me a gold stripe. Your loving child,
    ALGY.'</p>

    <p>"Now mind the word. Ride&mdash;Can&mdash;ter!"</p>

    <p>He cracks his whip; the horses throw up their heads and
    break into a canter; the cavaliers turn pea-green about the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> chops, let go the reins and
       clutch saddle-pommels.</p>

    <p>The leading horse, a rakish chestnut, finding his head free
    at last and being heartily fed-up with the whole business,
    suddenly bolts out of the <i>man&egrave;ge</i> and legs it
    across the meadow, <i>en route</i> for stables and tea. His
    eleven mates stream in his wake, emptying saddles as they
    go.</p>

    <p>The ten little <i>gamins</i> dance ecstatically upon the
    bank, waving their shirts and shrilling "<i>&Agrave; Berlin!
    &Agrave; Berlin!</i>"</p>

    <p>The ancient Gaul props himself up against the pie-bald cow
    and shakes his ancient head. "<i>C'est la guerre</i>," he
    croaks.</p>

    <p>The deserted Riding-Master damns his eyes and blesses his
    soul for a few moments; then sighs resignedly, takes a
    cigarette from his cap lining, lights it and waddles off
    towards the village and his favourite <i>estaminet</i>.</p>

    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p><i>From Fred Golightly, comedian, to Sinclair Voyle,
    dramatic critic.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR VOYLE,&mdash;I am not one ordinarily to take any notice
    of remarks that are overheard and reported to me; but there are
    exceptions to every rule and I am making one now. I was told
    this evening by a mutual friend and fellow-member that at the
    Buskin Club, after lunch to-day, in the presence of a number of
    men, you said that the trouble with me was that I had no sense
    of humour.</p>

    <p>Considering my standing as a comedian, hitherto earning high
    salaries and occupying the place I do solely by virtue of my
    comic gifts (as the Press and Public unanimously agree), this
    disparagement from a man wielding as much power as you do is
    very damaging. Managers hearing of it as your honest opinion
    might fight shy of me.</p>

    <p>I therefore ask you to withdraw the criticism with as much
    publicity as it had when you defamed me by making it.</p>

    <p>Why you should have made it at all I can't imagine, for I
    have often seen you laughing in your stall, and we have been
    friends for many years.</p>

    <p>Believe me, yours sincerely but sorrowfully, FRED
    GOLIGHTLY.</p>

    <p>II.</p>

    <p><i>From Sinclair Voyle, dramatic critic, to Fred Golightly,
    comedian.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR GOLIGHTLY,&mdash;You have been misinformed. I didn't
    say you had no sense of humour; I said you had no sense of
    honour.</p>

    <p>Yours faithfully, SINCLAIR VOYLE.</p>

    <p>III.</p>

    <p><i>From Fred Golightly, comedian, to Sinclair Voyle,
    dramatic critic.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR OLD CHAP,&mdash;You can't think how glad I am to have
    your disclaimer. I disliked having to write to you as I did,
    after so many years of good fellowship, but you must admit that
    I had some provocation. It is a pretty serious thing for a man
    in my position to be publicly singled out by a man in yours as
    being without a sense of humour. However, your explanation puts
    everything right, and all's well that ends well. Yours as ever,
    FRED.</p>

    <h2>A LITERAL EPOCH.</h2>

    <p>That there rumpus i' the village laast Saturday night? Aye,
    it were summat o' a rumpus, begad! Lor! there aren't bin
    nothin' like it not since the time when they wuz a-gwain' to
    burn th' ould parson's effigy thirty-fower year ago (but it
    niver come off, because 'e up an' offered to contribute to the
    expenses 'isself, an' that kind o' took the wind out on't).</p>

    <p>Ye see, Sir, there's just seven licensed 'ouses i' the
    village. Disgraceful? Aye, so 'tis, begad!&mdash;on'y seven
    licensed 'ouses&mdash;an' I do mind when 'twas pretty nigh one
    man one pub, as the sayin' is. Howsomever, to-day there's
    seven, and some goes to one and some goes to totherun.</p>

    <p>Well, laast Friday night me an' Tom Figgures an' Bertie Mayo
    an' Peter Ledbetter an' a lot more on us what goes to Reuben
    Izod's at The Bell, we come in to 'ave our drink. And, mind
    you, pretty nigh all on us 'ad a-bin mouldin'-up taters all
    day, so's to get <i>them</i> finished afore the hay; so us
    could do wi' a drop. Aye, aye!</p>

    <p>Well, fust thing us knowed&mdash;no more'n a hour or two
    after&mdash;Mrs. Izod was a-sayin' to old Peter Ledbetter, as
    'er set down a fresh pint for 'n, "That's the laast drop o'
    beer i' the 'ouse," 'er says.</p>

    <p>"<i>Whaat</i>!" says Peter, though there warn't no call for
    'im to voice the gen'ral sentiments, 'coz you see, Sir, 'e'd
    a-got the laast pint an' us 'adn't.</p>

    <p>"There's a nice drop o' cider, though," says Mrs. Izod.
    "Leastways, when I says a nice drop, there's a matter o'
    fifteen gallons, I dessay," 'er says.</p>

    <p>"I 'ave drunk cider at a pinch," says Bertie Mayo,
    cautious-like, "and my ould father, I d' mind, 'e'd used to
    drink it regular."</p>

    <p>"Ah, that 'a did!&mdash;an' mine too, and 'is father afore
    'un," says Tom Figgures; "but I reckon 'tisn't what 'twas in
    them days."</p>

    <p>"Well, you may do as you'm a-minded 'bout 'avin' it," says
    Mrs. Izod; "but no more ain't beer what 'twas neether, come to
    that."</p>

    <p>"You'm right there, Missus," says all the rest on us.</p>

    <p>An' then Bertie Mayo, 'oo's allus a turr'ble far-seeing sort
    of chap, 'e says, "Reckon the trolley 'ull be along fust thing
    i' the marnin' from the brewery, Missus?" An' when Mrs. Izod
    'er says as 'er didn't know, but 'twas to be 'oped as 'twud, a
    sort of a blight settled down on the lot on us, which I reckon
    is a pretty fair way o' puttin' it, for a blight allus goes
    'and-in-'and wi' a drought.</p>

    <p>Well, either us finished that evenin' up on cider or us
    finished the cider up that evenin'&mdash;there warn't much in
    it one way or t'other. An' next day&mdash;this bit as I'm
    a-tellin' you now us niver 'eard tell on till arterwards, but
    I'm a-tellin' it <i>yeou</i> just as it 'appened&mdash;next
    <i>daay</i> (that were Sat'rday, mind) there was a turr'ble
    to-do in the arternoon, for there warn't nobbut limonade in the
    house when them timber-haulin' chaps stopped to waater the
    engin'. Well, you may reckon!...</p>

    <p>An' then, when us come 'ome from work, us found the door o'
    The Bell shut an' locked, an' "Sold Out" wrote on a piece o'
    cardboard i' the parlour winder by Reuben Izod's second child!
    Begad, that was sommut if yeou like! Us stud there a-gyaupin'
    an' a-gyaupin', till at last Peter Ledbetter give a kick at the
    door and 'ollers out, "Whatten a gammit do 'ee call this 'ere,
    Reuben Izod? 'Tis drink us waants, not tickets for the Cook'ry
    Demonstration." (Turr'ble sarcastic 'e do be sometimes, Peter
    Ledbetter).</p>

    <p>"I aren't got none," says Reuben from be'ind the door.</p>

    <p>"Well, cider, then," says Bertie Mayo.</p>

    <p>"Tall 'ee I aren't got narrun&mdash;beer, cider, nor
    limonade&mdash;nary a drop. 'Tiddn' no manner o' good for you
    chaps to stan' there. You'd best toddle along up to The Green
    Dragon an' see if Mas'r Holtom've got any."</p>

    <p>Well, bein' as no one iver yet 'eard tell o' one publican
    tellin' ye to go furder a-fild and get sarved by another
    publican (savin' as 'twas a drunken man as 'e wanted to be shut
    on), us was struck so dazed-like as us went along the road wi'
    never a word. But us 'adn't got 'alfway theer afore us met
    Johnnie Tarplett, Jim Peyton, and a lot more on 'em all comin'
    along the road towards we.</p>

    <p>"Where be gwain'?" says Johnnie Tarplett.</p>

    <p>"Us be gwain' along to The Green Dragon to get a drop o'
    drink," says Tom Figgures.</p>

    <p>"The Green Dragon's shut 'owever," says Johnnie Tarplett.
    "Us was a-gwain' along&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye!" us sings out. "So's The Bell shut too!"</p>

    <p>Well, then us all took and went along to The Reaper, an'
    <i>that</i> were shut, an' The Dovedale Arms (which is an
    oncomfortably superior sort of a 'ouse, dealin' in sperrits)
    was down to ginger-wine, an' The Crown and The Corner Cupboard
    an' The Ploughman's Rest was all crowded out an' gettin' down
    to the bottom o' the casks.</p>

    <p>An' then, when us took an' thowt as 'twould be 'ay-makin'
    next week, an' dry weather all round, us stuud i' the road and
    spak our thowts out.</p>

    <p>"Dom the KEYSER!" says Peter Ledbetter, to gie us a start
    like.</p>

    <p>"Niver knowed sich a thing afore in all my born days," says
    Bertie Mayo. "Niver knowed The Bell shut yet, not since 'twas
    first opened six years afore th' ould QUEEN come to the
    throne."</p>

    <p>"Reckon sich a thing niver 'appened afore i' the history o'
    Dovedale parish," says Johnnie Tarplett.</p>

    <p>"Niver since WILL'UM CONQUEROR," says Jim Peyton.</p>

    <p>"Niver since NOAH 'isself," says Tom Figgures.</p>

    <p>"'Tis a nepoch, look you," says Peter Ledbetter. An' though
    us didn' know what 'a meant no more'n 'a did 'isself, us were
    inclined to agree wi 'm. Oh, 'tis a Greek word meanin' a
    stoppage, is it? Well, if what you say be <i>trew</i>, Peter
    Ledbetter was right 'owever, an' them Greeks is at the bottom
    of all the trouble, as I said in The Bell five nights
    ago&mdash;my son bein' at Salonika, as you do know, Sir.</p>

    <p>An' arter a bit us all went along home, all on us tryin' to
    remember what us knowed about home-brewin'. An' if you
    gentlefolks doan't get your washin' done praperly this wik 'tis
    along o' the tubs bein' otherwise engaaged.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, July 23rd</i>.&mdash;The country awoke this
    morning to find itself threatened with a first-class political
    crisis and possibly a General Election to follow. Members
    dwelling temporarily on the Western Front had reluctantly torn
    themselves from their dug-outs on the receipt of a three-line
    whip, and had repaired post-haste to Westminster.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/79-1.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>The trouble was nominally about the agricultural labourer
    and his minimum wage. Should it be twenty-five shillings, as
    set down in the Corn Production Bill, or thirty shillings, as
    proposed by Mr. WARDLE, the Leader of the Labour Party? The
    Amendment had the assent of the hard-shell Free-Traders, who
    were glad to snatch at any chance of defeating the proposed
    bounty to the farmer. They had been further incensed by the
    appointment of Messrs. MONTAGU and CHURCHILL to the Ministry,
    and hoped perhaps that some of the extreme Tories would help
    them to give the PRIME MINISTER a good hard knock.</p>

    <p>Mr. PROTHERO made it plain from the outset that the
    Government meant to stand or fall by the proposal in the Bill;
    and most of the friends of the agricultural labourer prudently
    preferred twenty-five shillings in the hand to thirty shillings
    in the bush; with the result that the amendment was defeated by
    301 to 102.</p>

    <p>Mr. HOGGE called attention to the anomalous position
    occupied by Dr. ADDISON. The late Minister for Munitions and
    future Minister for Reconstruction is for the moment only an
    ordinary Member. Ought he not therefore to be re-elected before
    taking up his new appointment? Mr. SPEAKER'S judicious reply,
    "I do not appoint Ministers," left one wondering what sort of
    an appearance the Treasury Bench would present if he did.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, July 24th</i>.&mdash;Major HUNT and Mr. KING,
    though in some respects not unlike one another&mdash;each
    combining a child-like belief in what they are told outside the
    House with an invincible scepticism in regard to the
    information they receive from Ministers inside&mdash;are rarely
    found hunting in couples. But they made common cause to-day
    over the alleged award of the Distinguished Service Order to
    persons who had never been near the firing line, and they
    refused to accept Mr. MACPHERSON'S assurance that it was only
    given for service in the field. Mr. KING knew for a fact that a
    gentleman in France who had only served in the Post-Office had
    received it&mdash;presumably for not deserting his post; while
    Major HUNT could not understand how anyone should have earned
    it for fighting at home. "How has this country been attacked?"
    he asked indignantly. Air-raids evidently do not count with
    this gallant yeoman.</p>

    <p>Efficiency, not economy, is the PRIME MINISTER'S watchword.
    Sir EDWARD CARSON as a Member of the War Cabinet will have no
    portfolio, but will enjoy the not inadequate salary of five
    thousand a year for what the Profession calls "a thinking
    part." The new Minister of Reconstruction is to have two
    thousand a year; and we shall no doubt hear shortly that he has
    begun his labours by reconstructing another hotel for the
    accommodation of his staff.</p>

        <h3>THE SECRET SERVICE IN THE HOUSE.</h3>MR. KING HAS
        SUSPICIONS OF SOMETHING NEFARIOUS.
    </div>

    <p>With the spirit of expansion pervading the Head of the
    Government, it is not surprising that the expenditure of the
    country continues to rise. The panting estimators of the
    Treasury toil after it in vain. Mr. McKENNA's passionate plea
    for a limit to our war-expenditure would have carried more
    weight if he had shown any sign during his own time at the
    Exchequer of being able to impose one. As it was, Mr. G.D.
    FABER'S interjection, "Do you want to limit munitions?" quickly
    reduced him to generalities. The House had to rest content with
    Mr. BONAR LAW'S assurance that, though we could not go on for
    ever, we could go on longer than our enemies.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, July 25th</i>.&mdash;In answer to Mr.
    PEMBERTON-BILLING the UNDER-SECRETARY FOR WAR stated that since
    the outbreak of hostilities there had been forty-seven airship
    raids and thirty "heavier than air" raids upon this country,
    "making seventy-eight air-raids in all." It is believed that
    the discrepancy is explained by Mr. BILLING'S unaccountable
    omission on one occasion to make a speech.</p>

    <p>He made one to-night of prodigious length, which brought him
    into personal collision with Major ARCHER-SHEE. Palace Yard was
    the scene of the combat, which ended, as I understand, in
    ARCHER downing PEMBERTON and BILLING sitting on SHEE. Then the
    police arrived and swept up the hyphens.</p>

    <p>Opinions differ as to Mr. KING'S latest performance. Some
    hold his complaint, that the Government had introduced
    detectives into the precincts of the House, to have been
    perfectly genuine, and point to his phrase, "I speak from
    conviction," as a proof that he was trying to revenge himself
    for personal inconvenience suffered at the hands of the minions
    of the law. Others contend that he knew all the time the real
    reason for their presence&mdash;the possibility that Sinn Fein
    emissaries would greet Mr. GINNELL'S impending departure with a
    display of fireworks from the Gallery.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, July 26th</i>.&mdash;Mr. GINNELL put in a
    belated appearance this afternoon in order to make a dramatic
    exit. But the performance lacked spontaneity.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> Indeed honourable Members,
       even while they laughed, were, I think, a little saddened by
       the sight of this elderly gentleman's pathetic efforts to
       play the martyr.</p>

    <p>Only twenty Members agreed with Mr. RAMSAY MACDONALD in
    believing, or affecting to believe, that the recent resolution
    of the German Reichstag was the solemn pronouncement of a
    sovereign people, and that it only requires the endorsement of
    the British Government to produce an immediate and equitable
    peace. Not much was left of this pleasant theory after Mr.
    ASQUITH had dealt it a few of his sledge-hammer blows. "So far
    as we know," he said, "the influence of the Reichstag, not only
    upon the composition but upon the policy of the German
    Government, remains what it has always been, a practically
    negligible quantity."</p>

    <p>Any faint hopes that the pacificists may have cherished of a
    favourable division were destroyed by Mr. SNOWDEN in a speech
    whose character may be judged by the comment passed on it by
    Mr. O'GRADY, just back from Russia, that "LENIN had preached
    the same doctrine in Petrograd."</p>

    <h2>MILITARY AIDES.</h2>

    <p>Last year, owing to the pressure of other engagements, we
    did not mark out the tennis-lawn at "Sunnyside." This year the
    matter has been taken out of our hands by the military
    powers.</p>

    <p>Nevin was the first to think of it.</p>

    <p>"What about a game of tennis?" he suggested one bright
    morning in May. "Keep us from going to seed."</p>

    <p>It was his second day of leave after three months in the
    Ypres salient, so the change may have been too sudden for
    him.</p>

    <p>"That's a toppin' notion," echoed Bob; "let's raid 'old
    Beetle's' museum and dig out the posts."</p>

    <p>So Captain Richard Nevin, R.E., and Second-Lieutenant Robert
    Simpson, R.G.A., took the affair into their own hands.</p>

    <p>Having seen the same forces cooperating on previous
    occasions, I determined to keep clear of them. Besides, I am
    only "old Beetle."</p>

    <p>They found the posts in the tool-shed, and, borne upon the
    initial enthusiasm of their venture, began to sink a sort of
    winze on each side of the lawn. Up to this point they were
    perfectly amicable.</p>

    <p>Then Nevin, who is a thoughtful person, said suddenly, "I
    suppose you made quite sure that the line of these posts will
    cross the centre of the court?" And then, before Bob could
    retort, added, "Of course you ought to have made absolutely
    certain of that. As it is we had better leave this and find the
    corner irons."</p>

    <p>Corner irons that have remained undisturbed for some
    twenty-four months have a way of concealing themselves. At the
    end of ten minutes the seekers began to show signs of
    impatience. Such terms as "angles," "bases," "centres,"
    interspersed with "futilass," "sodamsure," "knowseverything"
    were cast upon a hazardous breeze.</p>

    <p>Eventually they found one of the angles. To the ordinary
    layman this would have meant the beginning of the end. But
    Captain Richard Nevin and Second-Lieutenant Robert Simpson are
    made of different stuff. They scorn the easy path. They have
    stores of deep knowledge to draw upon which place their
    calculations beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. After they had
    made a searching examination of the exhumed angle, Bob pulled
    out a pencil, prostrated himself behind it and then proceeded
    to gaze ecstatically over the top.</p>

    <p>I moved my chair slightly south, and pretended to regard the
    apple-blossom, and when Nevin went into the house and brought
    out something which dimly resembled a ship's sextant I had the
    extreme presence of mind not to make any inquiries.</p>

    <p>Margery drifted up with a pink duster.</p>

    <p>"What ever are they doing?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Hush!" I whispered; "Bob has just got the range of a supply
    train on the far side of the rockery, and if Nevin (Nevin is
    the Crown Prince of Wurtemberg) doesn't get the longitude of
    Bob's battery in the next minute or so it's all up with his
    day's rations."</p>

    <p>Suddenly Bob rose and made some calculations on an old
    envelope.</p>

    <p>"That means three rounds battery fire," I said, "and the
    Prince loses his lunch."</p>

    <p>Not satisfied with this success, Bob went indoors and looted
    the hall of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> three walking-sticks and
       Margery's new sunshade.</p>

    <p>"What's he going to do now?" said Margery, with one eye on
    the sunshade.</p>

    <p>He walked to the far end of the lawn and manoeuvred in a
    small circle. "The water-jackets are boiling," I replied, "and
    they've run out of cold water. He's divining with the sunshade.
    Look!"</p>

    <p>Bob suddenly drove the sunshade into the ground. There was a
    sharp crack and&mdash;well, he found another iron. Of course he
    tried to explain to Margery that it was an absolute accident
    and he only wanted to get a sighting post; but that was mere
    self-effacement, and I said so.</p>

    <p>Things began to happen quickly after this, and if Private
    James Thompson had not put in an unexpected appearance they
    might have completed the job without any further difference of
    opinion.</p>

    <p>In the merry days before war was thrust upon us, James
    Thompson was an architect of distinction. Obviously an
    architect of distinction can reduce the difficulty of laying
    out a tennis-court to an elementary and puerile absurdity. For
    half-an-hour the demonstration was carried on in the garden,
    and, after Private Thompson had twice been threatened with
    arrest for using insubordinate language to a superior, it was
    decided to finish the discussion in my study, assisted by the
    softening influence of the Tantalus.</p>

    <p>Not for a hundred pounds would I have ventured into the
    study. I picked up <i>The Gardening Gazette</i> and engrossed
    myself in an interesting piece of scandal about the slug
    family.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Margery appeared at the double.</p>

    <p>"Do you know," I exclaimed excitedly, "it was the wireworm
    after all."</p>

    <p>"Come on," Margery panted irrelevantly, "buck up and we can
    finish it before they come out again."</p>

    <p>In her hand she held a tape-measure and an official diagram
    of a tennis-court.</p>

    <p>Five minutes later the experts emerged from the house.</p>

    <p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Nevin aggressively, "what have you been
    up to?"</p>

    <p>"Oh," I replied, flicking over a page on weed-killers,
    "Margery and I thought we had better find the remainder of the
    tennis-court while you were having a rest. Margery's gone for a
    ball of string, and if Bob fetches the marker you can mark the
    court out now."</p>

    <p>Nevin's retort was addressed solely to Private James
    Thompson, who had in an unfortunate moment given way to
    laughter of an unmilitary character.</p>

    <h2>"DIVISIONAL SIGNS."</h2>

    <p>The purpose of a Divisional Sign is to deceive the enemy.
    Let us suppose that you belong to the 580th Division, B.E.F.
    You do not put "580" on your waggons and your limbers and on
    the tin-hats of your Staff. Certainly not. The enemy would know
    about you if you did that. You have a secret sign, such as
    tramps chalk on your wall at home, to let other tramps know
    that you are a stingy devil with a dog. There are many theories
    as to how these signs are chosen. One is that a committee of
    officers sits <i>in camer&acirc;</i> for forty-eight hours
    without food or drink till it has decided on an arrow or a cat,
    or a dandelion, rampant.</p>

    <p>Let us take it that a cat is chosen&mdash;a quiet thing in
    cats&mdash;crimson on a green-and-white chess-board background.
    Forthwith (as adjutants say) a crimson cat on a green-and-white
    chess-board background is painted and embroidered on everything
    that can be painted and embroidered on&mdash;limbers and
    waggons and hand-carts and arm-bands and the tin-hats of the
    Staff. And the Division goes forth as it were masked,
    disguised, just like one of Mr. LE QUEUX'S diplomatist heroes
    at a fancy-dress ball, wearing a domino. You perceive the
    mystery of it? None of your naked numbers for us B.E.F. men.
    The Division marches through a village, and the dear old Man
    Who Knows, cropping up again in the army, says, "Ha! A red cat
    on a green-and-white chess-board back-ground? That's the
    Seventeenth Division."</p>

    <p>You see it now? The enemy agent overhears. The false news is
    sent crackling through the ether to Berlin (wireless, my dear,
    in the cellar, of course). The German General Staff looks up
    the village on a map, and sticks into it a flag marked 17. Not
    580, mark you. And the General Staff frowns, and Majesty pushes
    the ends of its moustache into its eyes at the knowledge that
    the Seventeenth Division is in &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

    <p>And all the time it is in &mdash;&mdash;! And the agent
    pockets his cheque. So wars are won and lost.</p>

    <p>Just conceive the romance of it. It is heraldry gone
    mad.</p>

    <p>Myself, however, I incline to another theory as to the
    origin of these symbols.</p>

    <p>A Higher Command enters his office. Higher Commands always
    enter. The office is hung, like a studio in one of Mr. GEORGE
    MORROW'S pictures, with diagrams of circles and triangles and
    crosses and straight lines. The Higher Command, being a man of
    like passions with ourselves, has just finished tinned Oxford
    marmalade and a cigarette. He heads for the "IN" basket on his
    desk and takes from it the "Arrivals and Departures" paper.
    "Ha!" says he to the lady secretary, "I see six new divisions
    landed yesterday." He pauses. Outside there is no sound to be
    heard save the loud and continuous crash of the sentry's hand
    against his rifle as he salutes the passing A.D.C.'s. "What
    about signs?" says the Higher Command. The lady secretary says
    nothing. She floods the carburettor of the typewriter
    preparatory to thumping out "Ref. attached correspondence" on
    it.</p>

    <p>The Higher Command stares at the diagrams on the wall. He is
    feeling strangely light-hearted this morning. He has won five
    francs at bridge the night before from the D.A.D.M.O. A.D.G.S.
    And mere circles and squares have somehow lost their savour for
    him. He plunges. "What about a lion?" he says.</p>

    <p>The lady secretary opens the throttle and plays a few bars
    on the "cap." key.</p>

    <p>"A red lion?" says the Higher Command seductively.</p>

    <p>"It has already been done," says the lady secretary
    coldly.</p>

    <p>"Who by&mdash;I mean by whom?" inquires the H.C.
    indignantly.</p>

    <p>"By the Deputy Assistant Director of Higher Commands, when
    you were on leave last week," she tells him.</p>

    <p>He mutters a military oath against the D.A.D.H.C. Then his
    face clears.</p>

    <p>"Tigers?" he suggests hopefully.</p>

    <p>"We might do a green tiger," she says reluctantly.</p>

    <p>"With yellow stripes!" shouts the H.C.</p>

    <p>"On a mauve background," says she, warming to it.</p>

    <p>And so one division is disposed of. But it is not always so,
    of course.</p>

    <p>After a Hun counter-attack, for instance, the H.C. may gaze
    morosely on his geometrical figures and throw off a little
    thing in triangles and St. Andrew's crosses. Or when the moon
    is at the full you may have a violet allotted to you as your
    symbol. One never knows. My own divisional sign, for instance,
    is an iddy-umpty plain on a field plainer. We vary the heraldry
    by ringing changes on the colours. On our brigade arm-band it
    becomes an iddy-umpty gules on a field azure. If I could be
    quite sure of the heraldic slang for puce I would tell you what
    it is on our Army Corps arm-band. On a waggon it used to be an
    iddy-umpty blank on a field muddy. But administrative genius
    has changed all that. A routine order, the other day, ordered a
    pink border to be painted round it, and this first simple essay
    of the departed Morse goes now through the villages of France
    in a bed of roses.</p>

    <p>We wish sometimes that our conditions were changed as easily
    as our signs.</p>

            strong,</p>

            <p>And the lane was rather flinty and the lane was
            rather long,</p>

            <p>When, up and down the gentle hills beside the
            stripling Test,</p>

            <p>I chanced to come to Bullington and stayed a while

            <p>It was drowned in peace and quiet, as the river

            scarce a sound;</p>

            <p>And the air was like a posy with the sweet haymaking

            <p>And the trout in sun-warmed shallows hardly seemed
            to stir a fin,</p>

            <p>Small and sleepy there it nestled, seeming far from

    <h2>REMEMBRANCE.</h2>

    <p>"Stop, Francesca," I cried. "Don't talk; don't budge; don't
    blink. Give me time. I've all but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What <i>are</i> you up to?" she said.</p>

    <p>"There," I said, "you've done it. I had it on the tip of my
    tongue, and now it has gone back for ever into the limbo of
    forgotten things, and all because you couldn't keep silent for
    the least little fraction of a second."</p>

    <p>"My poor dear," she said, "I <i>am</i> sorry. But why didn't
    you tell me you were trying to remember something?"</p>

    <p>"That," I said, "would have been just as fatal to it. These
    things are only remembered in an atmosphere of perfect silence.
    The mental effort must have room to develop."</p>

    <p>"Don't tell me," she said tragically, "that I have checked
    the development of a mental effort. That would be too
    awful."</p>

    <p>"Well," I said, "that's exactly what you <i>have</i> done,
    that and nothing less. I feel just as if I'd tried to go
    upstairs where there wasn't a step."</p>

    <p>"Or downstairs."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "it's equally painful and dislocating."</p>

    <p>"But you're not the only one," she said, "who's forgotten
    things. I've done quite a lot in that line myself. I've
    forgotten the measles and sugar and Lord RHONDDA and the Irish
    trouble and your Aunt Matilda, and where I left my
    <i>pince-nez</i> and what's become of the letters I received
    this morning, and whom I promised to meet where and when to
    talk over what. You needn't think you're the only forgetter in
    the world. I can meet you on that and any other ground."</p>

    <p>"But," I said, "the thing you made me forget&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I didn't."</p>

    <p>"You did."</p>

    <p>"No, for you hadn't remembered it."</p>

    <p>"Well, anyhow I shall put it on to you, and I want you to
    realise that it's not like one of your trivialities&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"This man," said Francesca, "refers to his Aunt Matilda and
    Lord RHONDDA as trivialities."</p>

    <p>"It is not," I continued inexorably, "like one of your
    trivialities. It's a most important thing, and it begins with a
    'B.'"</p>

    <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I'm sure it begins with a 'B'&mdash;or perhaps a 'W.'
    Yes, I'm sure it's a 'W' now."</p>

    <p>"I'm going," said Francesca with enthusiasm, "to coax that
    word or thing, or whatever it is, back to the tip of your
    tongue and beyond it. So let's have all you know about it.
    Firstly, then, it begins with a 'W.'"</p>

    <p>"Yes, it begins with a 'W,' and I feel it's got something to
    do with Lord RHONDDA."</p>

    <p>"That doesn't help much. So far as I can see, everything now
    is more or less nearly connected with Lord RHONDDA."</p>

    <p>"But my forgotten thing isn't bread or meat. It's something
    remoter."</p>

    <p>"Is it Mr. KENNEDY-JONES?" said Francesca. "He's just
    resigned, you know."</p>

    <p>"No, it's not Mr. KENNEDY-JONES. How could it be? Mr.
    KENNEDY-JONES doesn't begin with a 'W.'"</p>

    <p>"If I were you, I shouldn't insist too much on that 'W.' I
    should keep it in the background, for it's about ten to one
    you'll find in the end that it doesn't begin with a 'W.' At any
    rate we've made two short advances; we know it isn't Mr.
    KENNEDY-JONES, because he doesn't begin with a 'W,' and we are
    not very sure that it begins with a 'W.'"</p>

    <p>"Keep quiet," I said, flushing with anticipation. "I'm
    getting it ... your last remark has put me on the track....
    Silence.... Ah ... it's <i>DEVONSHIRE CREAM!</i>
    There&mdash;I've got it at last. I feel an overwhelming desire
    for Devonshire cream."</p>

    "Sammies" for our American Allies appeared in his columns as
    long ago as June 13th. On page 384 of that issue (after quoting
    <i>The Daily News</i> as having said, "We shall want a name for
    the American 'Tommies' when they come; but do not call them
    'Yankees'; they none of them like it") he wrote: "As a term of
    distinction and endearment, Mr. Punch suggests
    'Sammies'&mdash;after their uncle."</p>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>HANSI, the Alsatian caricaturist and patriot, who escaped a
    few months before the War, after being condemned by the German
    courts to fifteen months' imprisonment for playing off an
    innocent little joke on four German officers, and did his share
    of fighting with the French in the early part of the War, is
    the darling of the Boulevards. They adore his supreme skill in
    thrusting the irritating lancet of his humour into bulging
    excrescences on the flank of that monstrous pachyderm of
    Europe, the German. <i>Professor Knatschke</i> (HODDER AND
    STOUGHTON), aptly translated by Professor R.L. CREWE, is a
    joyous rag. It purports to be the correspondence of a Hun
    Professor, full of an egregious self-sufficiency and
    humourlessness and greatly solicitous for the unhappy Alsatian
    who is ignorant and misguided enough to prefer the Welsch
    (<i>i.e.</i> foreign) "culture-swindle" to the glorious
    paternal Kultur of the German occupation. And HANSI illustrates
    his witty text with as witty and competent a pencil. HANSI has,
    in effect, the full status of an Ally all by himself. He adds
    out of the abundance of his heart a diary and novel by
    <i>Knatschke's</i> daughter, <i>Elsa</i>, full of the artless
    sentimentality of the German virgin. It is even better fun than
    the Professor's part of the business. Naturally the full
    flavour of both jokes must be missed by the outsider. HANSI is
    the more effective in that he chuckles quietly, never guffaws
    and never rails. Fun of the best.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is not much left for me to say in praise of Mr. JACK
    LONDON'S dog-stories; and anyhow, if his name on the cover of
    <i>Jerry of the Islands</i> (MILLS AND BOON) is not enough, no
    persuasion of mine will induce you to read it. Those of us to
    whom dogs are merely animals&mdash;just that&mdash;will find
    this history of an Irish terrier dull enough; but others who
    have in their time given their "heart to a dog to tear" will
    recognise and joyously welcome Mr. LONDON'S sympathetic
    understanding of his hero. <i>Jerry's</i> adventurous life as
    here told was spent in the Solomon Islands, which is not, I
    gather, the most civilized part of the globe. He had been
    brought up to dislike niggers, and when he disliked anyone he
    did not hesitate to show his feelings and his teeth. So it is
    possible that for some tastes he left his marks a little too
    frequently; but in the end he thoroughly justified his
    inclination to indulge in what looked like unprovoked attacks
    upon bare legs. For unless he had kept his teeth in by constant
    practice he might never have contrived to save his beloved
    master and mistress from a very cowardly and crafty attack.
    Good dog, <i>Jerry</i>!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I admit that the fact of its publishers having branded
    <i>The Road to Understanding</i> (CONSTABLE) as "A Pure Love
    Story" did not increase the hopes with which I opened it. Let
    me however hasten also to admit that half of it certainly
    bettered expectation. That was the first half, in which
    <i>Burke Denby</i>, the heir to (dollar) millions, romantically
    defied his father and married his aunt's nursery governess, and
    immediately started to live the reverse of happy-ever after.
    All this, the contrast between ideals in a mansion and love in
    a jerry-built villa, and the thousand ways in which <i>Mrs.
    Denby</i> got upon her husband's nerves and generally blighted
    his existence, are told with an excellently human and
    sympathetic understanding, upon which I make my cordial
    congratulations to Miss ELEANOR H. PORTER. But because the
    book, however human, belongs, after all, to the category of
    "Best Sellers" it appears to have been found needful to furbish
    up this excellent matter with an incredible ending. That
    <i>Mrs. Denby</i> should retire with her infant to Europe, in
    order to educate herself to her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> husband's level, I did not
       mind. This thing has been done before now even in real life.
       But that, on returning after the lapse of years, she should
       introduce the now grown-up daughter, unrecognised, as
       secretary to her father! "Somehow ... you remind me
       strangely.... Tell me of your parents." "My daddy ... I
       never knew him." Or words to that effect. It is all there,
       spoiling a tale that deserved better.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The voracious novel-reader is apt to hold detective stories
    in the same regard that the Scotchman is supposed to entertain
    towards whisky&mdash;some are better than others, but there are
    no really bad ones. <i>The Pointing Man</i> (HUTCHINSON) is
    better than most, in the first place because it takes us "east
    of Suez"&mdash;a pleasant change from the four-mile radius to
    which the popular sleuths of fiction mostly confine their
    activities; and, secondly, because it combines a maximum of
    sinister mystery with a minimum of actual bloodshed; and,
    lastly, because our credulity is not strained unduly either by
    the superhuman ingenuity of the hunter or an excess of
    diabolical cunning on the part of the quarry. Otherwise the
    story possesses the usual features. There is the clever young
    detective, in whose company we expectantly scour the bazaars
    and alleys of Mangadone in search of a missing boy. There are
    Chinamen and Burmese, opium dens and curio shops, temples and
    go-downs. Miss MARJORIE DOUIE has more than a superficial
    knowledge of her stage setting, and gets plenty of movement and
    colour into it. And if she has elaborated the characters and
    inter-play of her Anglo-Burmese colony to an extent that is not
    justified either by their connection with the plot or the
    necessity of mystifying the reader we must forgive her because
    she does it very well&mdash;so well indeed that we may hope to
    see <i>The Pointing Man</i>, excellent as it is in its way,
    succeeded by a contribution to Anglo-Oriental literature that
    will do ampler justice to Miss DOUIE'S unquestionable
    gifts.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Our writers appear willing converts to my own favourite
    theory that the public is, like a child, best pleased to hear
    the tales that it already knows by heart. The latest exponent
    of this is the lady who prefers to be called only "The Author
    of <i>An Odd Farmhouse</i>." Her new little book, <i>Your
    Unprofitable Servant</i> (WESTALL), is a record of domestic
    happenings and impressions during the early phases of the War.
    The thing is skilfully done, and in the result carries you with
    interest from page to page; though (as I hint) the history of
    those August days, when Barbarism came forth to battle and
    Civilisation regretfully unpacked its holiday suit-cases, can
    hardly appeal now with the freshness of revelation. Still, the
    writer brings undeniable gifts to her more than twice-told
    tale. She has, for example, perception and a turn of phrase
    very pleasant, as when she speaks of the shops in darkened
    London conducting the last hour of business under lowered
    awnings, "as if it were a liaison." There are many such
    rewarding passages, some perhaps a little facile, but, taken
    together, quite enough to make this unpretentious little volume
    a very agreeable companion for the few moments of leisure which
    are all that most of us can get in these strenuous days.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I enjoyed at a pleasant sitting the whole of Mr. FRANK
    SWINNERTON'S <i>Nocturne</i> (SECKER). I don't quite know (and
    I don't see how the author can quite know) whether his
    portraits of pretty self-willed <i>Jenny</i> and plain
    love-hungry <i>Emmy</i>, the daughters of the superannuated
    iron-moulder, are true to life, but they are extraordinarily
    plausible. Not a word or a mood or a move in the inter-play of
    five characters in four hours of a single night, the two girls
    and "<i>Pa</i>," and <i>Alf</i> and <i>Keith</i>, the sailor
    and almost gentleman who was <i>Jenny's</i> lover, seemed to me
    out of place. The little scene in the cabin of the yacht
    between <i>Jenny</i> and <i>Keith</i> is a quite brilliant
    study in selective realism. Take the trouble to look back on
    the finished chapters and see how much Mr. SWINNERTON has told
    you in how few strokes, and you will realise the fine and
    precise artistry of this attractive volume. I can see the
    lights, the silver and the red glow of the wine; and I follow
    the flashes and pouts and tearful pride of <i>Jenny</i>, and
    <i>Keith's</i> patient, embarrassed, masterful wooing as if I
    had been shamefully eavesdropping.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Fool Divine</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) stands to some
    extent in a position unique among novels in that its heroine is
    also its villainess, or at least the wrecker of its hero.
    <i>Nevile del Varna</i>, the lady in question, is indeed the
    only female character in the tale, and has therefore naturally
    to work double tides. What happened was that young
    <i>Christopher</i>, a superman and hero, dedicate, as a
    volunteer, to the unending warfare of science against the evil
    goddess of the Tropics, yellow fever, met this more human
    divinity when on his journey to the scene of action, and, like
    a more celebrated predecessor, "turned aside to her." Then,
    naturally enough, when <i>Nevile</i> has gotten him for her
    husband and when love of her has caused him to abandon his
    project of self-sacrifice, she repays him with scorn. And as
    the unhappy <i>Christopher</i> already scorns himself the rest
    of the book (till the final chapters) is a record of
    deterioration more clever than exactly cheerful. The moral of
    it all being, I suppose, that if you are wedded to an ideal you
    should beware of taking to yourself a mortal wife, for that
    means bigamy. Incidentally the book contains some wonderfully
    impressive pictures of tropical life and of the general
    beastliness of existence on a rubber plantation. At the end, as
    I have indicated, regeneration comes for
    <i>Christopher</i>&mdash;though I will not reveal just how this
    happens. There is also a subsidiary interest in the
    revolutionary affairs of Cuba, which the much-employed
    <i>Nevile</i> appears to manage, as a local Joan of Arc, in her
    spare moments; and altogether the book can be recommended as
    one that will at least take you well away from the discomforts
    of here and now.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
